## Star Wars Web App Using Fetch API

In this project you will have to build a single page application that uses fetch() to retrieve information and display it on your website like this:

You are going to use the API: https://swapi.co/ to get the data and update it "randomly" in your website by clicking a button.

1.Create your Html, and select your elements. 

2.Create your functions, fetch the data (star wars characters) to display it as AJAX (make sure to display a loading message on the screen like this:

3.Make sure to fetch and display the "Home World" of the Star Wars Character (use console.log() to help you get the data)

4.If there is an Error by getting the data, display a message like this:

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devtlv/di-learning-courses/master/JavascriptCodingBootcamp/Week5/MiniProject/ERROR.png?token=AE22FLC5O22XEPQJDQJJYOC54Y7WM)

5. "You can use your own css to style it like you want"

Good luck!
